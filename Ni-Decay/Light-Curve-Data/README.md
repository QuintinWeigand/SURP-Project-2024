The file name is based on the follwing respectivly:
  1. The thing it is representing. (in this case light curves (LC))
  2. The ejecta mass
  3. The Nickle Mass (in terms of fraction of ejecta mass)
  4. The ejecta velocity
  5. The file type (.data in this case)


An example of this is:  "LC_0.8_0.1_1000.data"
  - Where 0.8 is the ejecta mass (in solar mass),
    0.1 is the decimal of the ejecta mass to represent Nickel Mass (10%),
    and 1000 is the ejecta velocity (in km/s) 


Within the file, it contains numerous lines of two values,
  1. The x-coordinate in days
  2. The y-coordinate which represents luminosity


Important note(s): 
  - All of these data points are derived from a radius of 1.0e8 in centimeters, The radius is not a changing factor between these results

  - There is only one file of the data within the current directory, depending on the scale the user desires it can get up to thousands of iterations.
    I am not posting all of the data generated here to prevent restrictions to the repo. \
    The data file within the current directory stands as an EXAMPLE.

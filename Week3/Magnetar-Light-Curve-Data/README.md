The file name is based on the follwing respectivly:

- The thing it is representing. (in this case magnetar light curves (M_LC))
- P (Period)
- B
- Ejecta Velocity (in km/s)
- Ejecta Mass (in solar mass)
- The file type (.data in this case)


An example a data file is: "M_LC_0.10_1.0_1000.0_2.0.data"
 
- Where 0.10 is the period, 1.0 is the B, 1000 is the ejecta velocity (in km/s), and 2.0 is the Ejecta Mass (in solar mass)


Within the file, it contains numerous lines of two values,

- The x-coordinate in days
- The y-coordinate which represents magnetar-luminosity 


Important note(s):

All of these data points are derived from a radius of 1.0e10 in centimeters, The radius is not a changing factor between these results

There is only one file of the data within the current directory, depending on the scale the user desires it can get up to thousands of iterations. I am not posting all of the data generated here to prevent restrictions to the repo.
The data file within the current directory stands as an EXAMPLE.
